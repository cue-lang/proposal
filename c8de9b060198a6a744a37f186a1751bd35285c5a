      "message": "As a new user of this feature, I might get confused between `keyOf` and `fieldOf`. Did we discard clearer alternatives to `keyOf` such as `fieldNameOf`?\n\nOr if we like `keyOf` as a counter to `valueOf`, and we think `fieldOf` should be rare, perhaps we call it something like `fieldValueOf`. Or since its use is mainly for cyclic structures, perhaps `cyclicFieldOf` or `cyclicValueOf`.\n\nI\u0027m especially worried about e.g. `[string]: string`, where the key and value are both strings. Choosing the wrong builtin could lead to a subtle bug.",

      "message": "I think this begs the question - why not add a similar alias for the root/top of the file as well? That seems like a use case that\u0027s roughly as common as \"self\", so if we are avoiding it for any particular reason, I think this document should say.\n\nDoing the `let Top \u003d self` declaration is fine, but it\u0027s perhaps a bit odd to have to sprinkle that across many files if it\u0027s a relatively common need.\n\nAlso, nit: I don\u0027t think we should encourage the use of \"top\" in this way, because the word in CUE already means \"any value\". I\u0027d personally choose \"root\".",
