## Objective / Abstract
[Delete me] A short description of the solved problem.

## Background

[Delete me] An introduction of the necessary background and the problem being
solved by the proposed change.

This section gives the reader a very rough overview of the landscape in which
the new thing is being built and what is actually being built. This isn't a
requirements doc. Keep it succinct! The goal is to bring readers up to speed.
Some previous knowledge can be assumed and detailed info can be linked to. This
section should be entirely focused on objective background facts.

It can be helpful to explicitly state what the non-goals are. Non-goals aren't
negated goals like "The system shouldn't crash", but rather things that could
reasonably be goals, but are explicitly chosen not to be goals. You might still
select a solution that satisfies a non-goal if it doesn't introduce trade-offs
that prevent achieving the goals.

## Overview / Proposal
[Delete me] Short overview of the design without describing all the details.

## Detailed Design
[Delete me] A design doc should be an efficient platform for design discussion
and documentation about the process towards final decision. The longer the
document gets the harder it becomes to consume and change. The document should
thus be as short as possible and as long as necessary. Given the design doc a
software engineer who either has existing experience in the subject matter or
is willing to invest to get that experience should be able to implement the
design doc.

### (optional) System Context Diagram
[Delete me] If applicable, a system context diagram can be very useful. It
shows the system as part of the larger technical landscape and allows readers
to contextualize the new design given its environment that they are already
familiar with.

### (optional) APIs
[Delete me] If the system under design exposes an API, then sketching out that
API is usually a good idea. In most cases, however, one should withstand the
temptation to copy-paste formal interface or data definitions into the doc as
these are often verbose, contain unnecessary detail and quickly get out of
date. Instead focus on the parts that are relevant to the design and its
trade-offs.

### (optional) Code and Pseudocode
[Delete me] Design docs should rarely contain code, or pseudo-code except in
situations where novel algorithms are described. As appropriate, link to
prototypes that show the implementability of the design.

## Alternatives Considered
[Delete me] What other alternatives are available to achieve the goals of the
design? Alternatives may be other possible designs or the use of an existing
system that does almost what is needed, the purchase of a standard software or
to do nothing at all.

## Cross-cutting Concerns
[Delete me] These are all heavily context dependent for each proposal. Examples
for such concerns are. Add and delete where applicable.

* privacy
* security
* scalability
* monitoring
