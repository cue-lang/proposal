Which would either restrict you to having a single file type in a directory hierarchy, or have to drop down to `type\u003dtext` and the do the decoding in CUE. That didn\u0027t feel satisfactory, hence flagging the issue. \n\nWhich I think means we need to work out what we could/would do in the case of `dir` (or some other mechanism). \n\nAnd indeed that\u0027s what with @mpvl@gmail.com I think we have now achieved: don\u0027t introduce `dir`, and instead commit to cover this case by implementing `**` support according to the LSP spec. I have linked to that in a new section under \"Other Considerations\".\n\nI have also left the wording as is:\n\n\u003e For glob, if the extension is not given, the `type` field is required.\n\nThat seems clear enough to me, and less technical than introducing the word \"constant\" (which doesn\u0027t appear to correspond to language in any description of a glob which was my main reservation).",
