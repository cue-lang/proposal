But if a central registry is not available, you have absolutely nothing to fall back on, which is surely worse.\n\nAlso, what do you mean by empty caches - on the client side, or server side? On the client side, downloading a zip from a proxy or a registry is equally efficient. On the server side, the proxy does have to do a VCS fetch the first time. This is an engineering challenge for the server to do quickly for sure, but as a user I never notice any slowness with the way the Go proxy does it.\n\nThere are two cases where the registry does seem more performant to me:\n\n1) Users disabling the proxy via `GOPROXY\u003ddirect`, falling back to old VCS downloads. The registry sidesteps this problem by not having two client-side modes.\n\n2) Private modules - in Go, most companies don\u0027t bother running their own private proxy, so they simply use the public proxy for public dependencies and VCS downloads for private ones.

Indeed now re-reading this paragraph for the 10th time I\u0027m not sure it makes sense:\n\n\u003e Cloning repositories can be costly. Using a VCS-backed proxy may result in      longer download times when dealing with empty caches or when a proxy is not available. Since CUE is often used in such contexts, this concern is even greater.\n\nOr put another way, I don\u0027t think it has the right focus.\n\nI think the points we should be trying to make here are:\n\n* The challenge with the Go (VCS-based) approach is that with private modules you have two choices as a module author (and by extension user): host your own proxy or have your users suffer the cost, instability etc of a direct VCS clone. \n* With a registry based approach, people can choose to run their own registry (for public or private modules, for various reasons), but there is no strict need to do so.\n* A VCS-based module system is going to be slower in general, because you can\u0027t always assume there is a proxy to amortise the clone time, the main reason being the point above about private modules. This does not apply for a registry approach.\n* If there _is_ a proxy available (for public and or private modules) in a VCS-based modules system, you _can_ amortise the clone time, but the initial clone time in the proxy remains. This point seems incredibly minor relative to the point about private modules. \n\nHence I think the main point to make here is that in the case of private modules in a VCS-based system, because there is not guaranteed to be a proxy available, the cost of cloning etc cannot always be amortised. \n\ni.e. right now I don\u0027t think we are missing a lede on that fact that this situation arises in a VCS-based system like Go because the public proxy does not handle private modules. The fact that the _proxy_ is VCS backed is not relevant: because we\u0027re talking about a situation where a proxy is not (generally) available.\n\nHence I think your attempted rewording is closer but I\u0027m not keen on the wording. \n\nHow about this.\n\n\u003e VCS-backed public proxies do not host private modules. As an author of a private module you therefore have two choices: host your own proxy, or have your users fall back to a direct VCS clone. Cloning VCS repositories can be unreliable and costly, especially where a user has empty caches. Private modules in CUE will be very common, as will situations where users resolve and download dependencies with empty caches. A registry based design naturally and natively supports private modules, and entirely side steps any costs associated with VCS clones.",

Go chose `go: X.Y` in isolation years ago, well before they thought they would need other \"version\" fields like `toolchain: X.Y.Z`. I suspect they might well want to add a \"minimum version\" field at some point as well.\n\nGo\u0027s current state is awkward:\n\n```\ngo: 1.18\ntoolchain: 1.19.3\n```\n\nWhat is `go:` there? You and I know it actually means the language spec version, but it\u0027s far too easy to mistake it for a minimum version. We\u0027ve covered this kind of confusion at length in the Go issue tracker before :) \n\nIt\u0027s very likely that we will want more \"version\" fields in module.cue in the future, much like Go is doing. For that reason, I would steer clear of `cue: X.Y` due to its ambiguity.\n\nPersonally, I would go with `cue: spec?: #Semver`. It is clear and not too verbose. We could always omit the `cue` part and do `spec?: #Semver` directly, although it\u0027s nice for the file contents alone to still mention that this is a CUE module.\n\nYou can then imagine a future where we also add `toolchain` in a natural way:\n\n```\ncue: {\n  spec?: #Semver\n  toolchain?: #Semver\n}\n```",

Its left to the user to check (via cmd/go) whether any version they are depending is retracted/deprecated. \n\nReference:\n\n\u003e After go get has selected a new set of versions, it checks whether any newly selected module versions or any modules providing packages named on the command line are retracted or deprecated. go get prints a warning for each retracted version or deprecated module it finds. go list -m -u all may be used to check for retractions and deprecations in all dependencies.\n\nTaken from https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-get\n\nAs such, I\u0027ll remove this field, leave the comment open for @rog to comment either way. \n\nIn a later revision we should add a comment about how the registry will offer the ability to mark versions as retracted and/or deprecated, but again I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a blocker for the initial version of this document.",

Completely agree with your point.\n\nWhat we could make clearer is that retractions are therefore something that feed into the MVS implementation (the Go diagrams are good in this respect). Hence deleting a module version is not necessary. \n\nSo there are indeed two things to change in this sentence:\n\n* Confirm that we mean \"deleted\" where it currently reads \"retracted\"\n* Clarify what we mean by \"change the scope\" of a package (module). Because I don\u0027t think we can support changing a module from being public to private, given the first point.\n\nWe also need to ensure we are consistent in the use of modules vs package. The use of package in this paragraph at least is wrong IMO. But I will make that change once we have agreed on the point about scope change, deletion etc.\n\n@mpvl to confirm though.",
